# Code-Tech-task1
PROJECT ON PYTHON LEARNING

Overview
This project creates an interactive weather dashboard that fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a visually appealing Streamlit web application. The dashboard shows current weather conditions, key metrics, and visualizations for a specified location.

Features
Real-time Weather Data: Fetches current weather conditions from OpenWeatherMap API

Interactive Dashboard: Built with Streamlit for easy web deployment

Comprehensive Metrics: Displays temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and rain volume

Data Visualization: Includes a bar chart visualization of weather parameters

Responsive Design: Adapts to different screen sizes

Requirements
Python 3.6+

Required libraries:

bash
pip install requests matplotlib seaborn pandas streamlit
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Get an API key from OpenWeatherMap

Run the dashboard:

bash
streamlit run weather_app.py
Configuration
Modify these variables in the code:

python
API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'  # Get from OpenWeatherMap
CITY = 'YourCityName'
lat = 'your_latitude'  # Optional: replace with your location
lon = 'your_longitude'  # Optional: replace with your location
How It Works
The application makes an API call to OpenWeatherMap using your coordinates

Weather data is parsed into individual metrics (temperature, humidity, etc.)

Streamlit displays the data in:

Metric cards organized in columns

A bar chart visualization

Current weather description

The dashboard automatically updates when the script runs

Example Output
The dashboard shows:

Current temperature and "feels like" temperature

Minimum and maximum temperatures

Humidity percentage

Atmospheric pressure

Wind speed

Rain volume (if applicable)

A bar chart comparing all weather parameters

Customization Options
Change the location by modifying CITY or lat/lon values

Add more weather parameters from the API response

Modify the visualization style (colors, chart types)

Add historical weather data comparison

Implement location search functionality

Deployment
To share your dashboard:

Deploy on Streamlit Sharing (free tier available)

Host on any cloud platform that supports Python web apps

Run locally and share via ngrok for temporary access
